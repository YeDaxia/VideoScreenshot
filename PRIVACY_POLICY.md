# Privacy Policy for 33字幕图 (Video Screenshot, Subtitle puzzle)

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **33字幕图** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Chrome Extension (the "Extension").

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data to external servers.**

### a. User Content (Screenshots)
The Extension allows you to capture screenshots from videos playing in your browser.
- **Local Processing**: All image processing (capturing, stitching, editing) happens entirely locally within your browser on your device.
- **No Uploads**: Your screenshots and the resulting combined images are **never** uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers. They exist only in your browser's memory while you are using the Extension and are cleared when you close the extension or the tab.

### b. Local Settings
We use `chrome.storage.local` to save your preferences, such as:
- Whether to show the floating screenshot button.

This data is stored locally on your device and is not synced or sent elsewhere.

## 2. Permissions

The Extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **`activeTab`**: Used to access the current tab to capture video frames when you trigger the action.
- **`scripting`**: Used to inject the code required to capture video frames from the webpage.
- **`sidePanel`**: Used to display the sidebar interface where you can view and edit your screenshots.
- **`storage`**: Used to save your local preferences (e.g., UI settings).
- **`Host Permissions (<all_urls>)`**: Required to allow the Extension to work on any website that contains a video you wish to capture. We do not track your browsing history.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension may contain links to external websites (e.g., Twitter/X, WeChat). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
